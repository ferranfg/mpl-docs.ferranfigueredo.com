# Introduction

Most writers have stories that are worth **gold**. The problem is getting these stories online. If you have a good story and want to sell it, there is a high probability that you are surprised by the number of tools you must handle when converting your content into an electronic book. 

:::note

Fortunately, there are publishing platforms such as Kindle Direct Publishing and others. So publishing an ebook or audiobook can be a bit easier.

:::

However, to self-publish your book on the platforms mentioned above, you need to have it in a formatted ebook file to upload to the publishing platforms.

This means that your completed and edited manuscript must be in one of the formats that will be presented below (depending on the platform which you want to self-publish):

- **.mobi** for Amazon
- **.ePub** for other stores
- **PDF** for ready-to-use books to print

Here is where MPL-Publisher comes in, a WordPress plugin that will allow you to sell your book online, making your ebook compatible with any of these platforms.

:::note

With our plugin, you can download in a matter of seconds your ebook from your WordPress blog in multiple formats.

:::

The only thing you need is a WordPress site. If you have your website already, all you have to do is download and activate the plugin, and it will be available on your site. That way, you will be able to share your ebooks with the world.
